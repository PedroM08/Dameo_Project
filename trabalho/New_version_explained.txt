# Dameo Project Improvements Summary
Overview of Changes from Version 1 to Version 2
This document summarizes the improvements made between version 1 and version 2 of the Dameo
game project. The changes include structural improvements, code refinements, new features, and AI
enhancements.

# Improved AI Implementation
## AI Player Enhancements
- AI Constructor Changes: Changed the AI initialization to accept a color parameter, making it easier to have AIs control either red or blue pieces.
- Evaluation Functions: More sophisticated evaluation functions in minimax_2.py that consider:
  - Piece counts
  - King counts
  - Positional advantages (distance to promotion rank)
  - Strategic positioning

# AI Architecture
Organized AI Hierarchy: Cleaner separation between different AI implementations with dedicated
files.

# Game Logic Improvements
## Capturing Mechanics
- King Captures: Improved king capture logic with direction restrictions during multi-captures.
- Multi-capture Sequences: Better handling of forced multi-capture sequences.
- Direction Tracking: Added tracking for the last direction a king moved, enforcing the rule that kings
cannot reverse direction in a capture sequence.

# Game Flow
- Turn Tracking: Added game_turns counter to track the number of turns played.
- Game Timing: Added timing functionality to measure how long games take.

# UI Improvements 
## Interface Elements 
- Instructions: Added an info button and instructions screen.
-  Return to Lobby: Added a return-to-lobby button for better navigation between game states. 
- AI Selection: Improved UI for selecting AI difficulty in both Player vs AI and AI vs AI modes. 

# Performance and Structure
- Code Organization 
- Function Refactoring: Better organization of functions with clearer responsibilities.
- Parameter Documentation: Improved comments explaining parameters and return values.

# Performance Optimizations 
- Alpha-Beta Pruning: Added pruning in minimax_3.py to dramatically improve search efficiency. 

# Bug Fixes 
- King Promotion: Fixed issues with king promotion during multi-capture sequences.
